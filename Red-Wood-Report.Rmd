## 1 Data Collection
### Paper Summary
The purpose of the study is twofold: capture information about a single redwood tree canopy over time and provide a roadmap for future macroscopic studies using a multi-sensor network.

The data was collected in Sonoma, California on a single Redwood tree over a period of days at consistent time intervals during the late spring/early summer.

Based on this study, researchers were able to verify the existence of dynamic spatio-temporal gradients surrounding the tree and prove that complex biological theories can be validated using this measurement framework. Researchers highlighted lesson's learned, beneficial for future studies, highlighting sensor sensitivity based on positioning and yield issues from memory/network constraints.

### How are sensors deployed? 
Nodes (sensor housing) were attached to the body of one redwood tree at various radial, angular, and vertical distances. At  roughly 2-meter spacing intervals the first sensor was placed 15m from ground level and the last sensor at 70m above ground level. The majority of nodes used in the analysis were placed on the west side of the tree about 0.1m - 1m from the tree trunk. Several nodes were placed outside of the measurement envelope to monitor readings in the immediate vicinity.

Nodes had two means of capturing/transferring data: on-site logger stored readings on-device and a separate workflow transferred readings over-the-wire to gateway (make sure this is correct when looking at file).

Sensors were calibrated before being deployed in the field using two trials called roof and chamber. In the roof exercise, nodes were placed in direct view of sunlight atop a building to test the PAR measurements and which were compared to a well known reference. In the chamber phase, temperature and humidity sensors exposed to wide range of conditions: from 5-30 degrees Celsius and between 20-90 %RH. Before being deployed the data harvesting querying was tested in field on a sample tree in similar conditions to verify communication between nodes and on-site internet connected gateway.

### What is the duration of data recording?
Data was recorded over period of almost 44 days from 4/27/2004 5:10pm (epoch 1) to 6/10/2004 2:00pm (epoch 12635). Measurements were taken every 5 minutes and battery operated nodes were duty cycled to conserve power when not operating (on for 4 seconds to take measurements then turned off until next reading). 

### What are the main variables of interest?
Researchers were interested in traditional climate variables temperature, humidity, and light levels which were measured via Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR). Light wavelengths between 350nmâ€“700nm were captured in two measurements: incident (direct), which provides information about energy available for photosynthesis, and reflected (ambient), which was used for satellite validation of measurements.

### What is difference between data in two different files?
Data in "sonoma-data-log.csv" represents sensor data saved from the logger to the flash memory on the actual node that was retrieved after the deployment. Data in "sonoma-data-net-csv" is the data retrieved from the wireless network during the deployment.

The main difference between the files is that the scaling/precision on voltage measurements appear different between the two sources. The network file also appears to have some row duplication.

***

## 2 Data Cleaning
```{r, read-in-data, include=FALSE}
all <- read.csv("sonoma-data-all.csv")
log <- read.csv("sonoma-data-log.csv")
net <- read.csv("sonoma-data-net.csv")

# metadata files
dates <- read.table("sonoma-dates-formatted", sep=",", header = TRUE)   # losing some precision on epochDays
```


### (a - histograms of each variable in each file)
```{r, hist-of-variables}
# add data source column indicating file source for direct hist comparison
voltage_log_cutoff = max(log$voltage)
all = all %>%
  mutate(data_source = case_when(
    voltage > voltage_log_cutoff ~ "net",
    voltage <= voltage_log_cutoff ~ "log"
))
```

```{r, network-failure, fig.cap = "Number of Entries by Epoch and Data Source"}
# plot themes need work
# epoch plot showing network failure
ggplot(all, aes(x = epoch, color = data_source)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 150) +
  # cosmetics
  labs(x="Epoch", y="Frequency", color="Data Source") +
  scale_color_brewer(palette="Spectral", labels=c("Logger", "Network"))
```

In Figure 1, the number of measurements recorded during each epoch is plotted for each data source: logger and network. Epoch range and record frequency are not consistent between the two, however, the distribution looks similar over the ranges where both have recorded data. The first network measurement occurs on epoch 2812 which corresponds to May 7th, almost 10 days after the experiment started. Tolle et al. cited packet drops and network related issues as potential culprit's to low network yield, but the data provided does not match the findings from Figure 7 in the original report. 

```{r, voltage-hist-range-issue, fig.cap = "Voltage Histogram - Units Differ by Data Source"}
# voltage plot shows issue with units
ggplot(all, aes(voltage, color = data_source, fill = data_source)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 50) +
  
  labs(x="Voltage", y="Frequency", color="Data Source") +
  scale_color_brewer(palette="Spectral", labels=c("Logger", "Network"))+
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Spectral", labels=c("Logger", "Network"))
```
Voltage units are not consistent across the two sources. Figure 2 plots the comparison and illustrates the scaling difference. The network voltage is several orders of magnitude greater than readings in the logger source. Voltage readings from the network source were converted to logger voltage units using the following formula.

$$ Voltage = (0.6)\frac{1024}{V_{network}} $$

Hamatop and hamabot dimensions were converted to match the PAR units in the original paper, but values were consistent across sources.

$$ \text{Incident PAR} = hamatop*0.0185 $$
$$ \text{Reflected PAR} = hamabot *0.0185 $$

Each record, unique to each data source, has a composite key identifier: nodeid and epoch. Figure 3 shows the number of nodeid/epoch combinations that appear more than once in the dataset. 

```{r, show-net-key-duplicates, fig.cap = "Number of (Epoch, Nodeid) Duplicated Entries by Data Source"}
# plot 2 showing number of measurements that have duplicated rows
# summarize(sum(n)) adds the counts together and yields total duplicated rows
all %>% 
  group_by(epoch, nodeid, data_source) %>%
  tally() %>%
  filter(n > 1) %>%
  group_by(data_source) %>% 
  tally() %>%   # summarize(sum(n)) (sums )
  ggplot(aes(x=data_source, y=n, fill = data_source)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
    geom_text(aes(label=n), position=position_dodge(width=0.9), vjust=-0.25) +
    # cosmetics
    labs(x="Data Source", y="Record Count", color="Data Source") +
    theme(legend.position = "none") +
    scale_color_brewer(palette="Spectral")
```

Out of this duplicate subset how many are unique entries? A unique entry indicates some dimension doesn't match between the duplicate rows and could indicate a faulty sensor or measurement reading. Measures were averaged for the nodeid/epoch entries identified as distinct duplicates.

### Comment on the number of missing measurements and the corresponding date/time period?
The time of day for the missing measurements (voltage only) appears uniform across the 24 hour range the sensors were active. Over the course of the experiment we see more NA measurements at the beginning of the experiment.


```{r, distibution-of-missing-measurements}
# time of day

ggplot(voltage_removed, aes(time)) +
    geom_bar(aes(fill = data_source)) +
    ggtitle("Time of Day - Missing Measurements")

# day
voltage_removed$date_concat = 
  as.Date(paste(voltage_removed$year, voltage_removed$month, voltage_removed$day), "%Y %b %d")

ggplot(voltage_removed, aes(date_concat)) +
    geom_bar(aes(fill = data_source)) +
    ggtitle("Day - Missing Measurements") +
    scale_x_date(breaks = scales::breaks_pretty(13))
```

### (c - incorporate location data from other file)
After we joined the location data, we have 15 variables.
```{r, incorporate-location-data}
locations <- read.table(file = "mote-location-data.txt", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
colnames(locations)[1] = "nodeid"

all = left_join(all, locations, by="nodeid")
```


### (d - visually identify outliers for each of following: humidity, humid temp, hamatop, hamabot. Remove and comment on rationale for removing)
Tolle mentioned two outlier related issues corresponding to humidity measurements: %RH greater than 100% and one node failing to track other measured values. 

We observed similar problems in our dataset. Visually inspecting the histogram we see a number of readings over 100%, clearly indicating a problem. Measurements corresponding to these readings were excluded from analysis.

Plotting individual nodes over time we identified nodeid 123 as the problem node (not tracking other readings) which starts to occur around epoch 5000. All sensor readings after this epoch were removed.

Visually inspecting temperature, we see a large number of outliers in the boxplot. A quick google search for hottest recorded temperature in Sonoma, CA is 44 degrees Celsius. Tolle's measurement ranges for temperature indicate a max value of 32.6 degrees Celsius. Looking at a temerature vs time plot at the height level it becomes clear that temperatures recorded in the high 30s/low 40s are erros. Thus, all measurements greater than 32.6 were removed.

Visually inspecting the incident par boxplot we see two distinct groups of outliers. We determined to remove the second group of outliers by enforcing a manual cutoff of < 2500.

```{r, identify-outliers}
# raw histograms
all %>%
 ungroup() %>%
 select(humidity, humid_temp, incident_par, reflected_par, .group = ) %>%
 keep(is.numeric) %>%
 gather() %>%
 ggplot(aes(value)) +
   facet_wrap(~ key, scales = "free") +
   geom_histogram()

# remove readings with humidity > 100%
boxplot(all$humidity, main = "humidity - with outliers")
all = all %>% filter(humidity <= 100)
boxplot(all$humidity, main = "humidity")

# paper mentions one node not tracking humidity with others i think nodeid 123
all %>% filter(nodeid == 119 | nodeid == 123) %>%
ggplot(aes(x = epoch, y = humidity, color = nodeid)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_color_gradientn(colours=rainbow(2)) +
  ggtitle("Node 119 and 123 Humidity Plots over Epoch")

# remove node 123 and epoch > 5000
all = all %>% filter((nodeid == 123 & epoch <= 5000) | (nodeid != 123))

# boxplots - use quantile function to remove
boxplot(all$reflected_par, main = "Reflected PAR")

# remove measurements based on temperature cutoff
boxplot(all$humid_temp, main = "humid temp - including outliers")
all = all %>% filter(humid_temp <= 32.6)
boxplot(all$humid_temp, main = "humid temp - outliers removed")

# remove incident par outliers
boxplot(all$incident_par, main = "Incident PAR - with outliers")
all = all %>% filter(incident_par < 2500)
boxplot(all$incident_par, main = "Incident PAR - without outliers")

## interquartile range - prompt says to visually inspect
# IQ_humid_temp = quantile(all$humid_temp, prob= c(0.01, 0.25, 0.75, 0.99))
# IQR = IQ_humid_temp["75%"] - IQ_humid_temp["25%"]
# IQ_humidity = quantile(all$humidity, prob= c(0.01, 0.25, 0.75, 0.99))
# IQ_incident_par = quantile(all$incident_par, prob= c(0.01, 0.25, 0.75, 0.99))
# IQ_reflected_par = quantile(all$reflected_par, prob= c(0.01, 0.25, 0.75, 0.99))
```


### (e bonus - discuss other possible outliers and explain reason why it is better to remove them than to keep)
Duplication issue. NaN issue (all rows are blank).

## 3 Data Exploration
### (a)
We decided to look at two distinct time periods, sunrise and sunset, as we belived they presented the most dynamic conditions to explore potential correlations. Would correlations observed during one event also manifest during the other? Researching sunrise and sunset times in Sonoma, CA during the months of the study lead us to select 5-hour intervals encompassing both astrological events.

#### Describe findings from the charts.
Humidity vs. temperature plot reveals a relationship between the two variables as many of the points look clustered together. We see that as temperature increases, humidity decreases. This trend appears linear during sunrise, but appears exponential/polynomial during sunset.

Correlation plots were created for each of the measured values which can be viewed as proxies for scatter plot relationships. Highlights from these figures include a strong positive correlation between incident and reflected PAR and a negative correlation between humidity and temperature. All correlations appear magnified (daker colors) during sunset indicating strong relationships.

### (b) Any predictors associated with Incident PAR. If so explain the relationship.
Temperature appears to be good predictor of incident PAR. We saw positive correlations between the two variables during both time frames.

Humidity displayed a negative correlation with incident PAR which is more pronounced during sunset.

Comment on the range, continuity and strange behaviors in these variables.
#### Temperature vs. Time
We artificially removed high temperature readings discussed earlier. We see a range of 6.78 - 32.6 degrees Celsius respectively.

There are some interesting trends in the temporal domain. All height sensors track the same general shape, but experience slight differences based on height that may indicate a relationship worth investigating. The high temperatures were almost exclusively acheived in the evenings (May 2nd/14th) by sensors mounter higher than 30m. This pattern is not consistent with the low temperature readings.

One interesting empirical note, we wee a local temperature max around May 31st that may indicate some meteorological event (heat wave, cold front, etc.) during the time period which could be interesting to focus future analysis on.

#### Humidity vs. Time
Humidity readings were artificially capped at 0% and 100% respectively. We see a range of 16.3% - 100% over the duration of collection. All sensors tracked the same general trend irrespective of sensor height which indicates no or weak relationship between height and humidity. One interesting thing manifested in this chart is around May 31st where we see humdity drop to a local min before increasing back up. This corresponds with the temperature increase we observed over the same temporal domain.

#### Incident PAR vs. Time
We see range of 0 and 2146 over duration of collection. Sensors mounted the highest often achieved the highest reading each day. The peaks and valleys represent the day and night distinction, with peaks during the day and valleys at night. On May 26th the chart experiences a much lower local max of ~800 when compared with the other days which might indicate some sort of sun blocking event (cloud cover, storm, etc.).

#### Reflected PAR vs. Time
We see range of 0 - 169 over duration of collection. We see most of the daily high readings correspond to the tallest mounted sensors and most of the daily lows with the lowest mounted sensors. One interesting observation from this plot is specific to the daily maximum's: there is much greater variability in this metric than seen in the incident PAR plot. Several days recorded max values that are much lower. One reading corresponds with the cloudy day (May 26th) noted in the incident PAR chart, but there are several other days which are interesting and may be worth investigating.

### (d) PCA Analysis & Scree Plot

```{r, pca-and-screeplot}
# perform pca
pr_comp = prcomp(all %>% ungroup() %>% select(humidity, humid_temp, incident_par, reflected_par), center = TRUE, scale. = TRUE)
summary(pr_comp)
pr_comp

# scree plot
eig_values = (pr_comp$sdev)^2 
eigs_cum <- cumsum(eig_values) /sum(eig_values)

# may be useful for plotting
ggplot() + geom_point(aes(x = 1:length(eig_values), y=eigs_cum)) +
  labs(x = "PC Number (in order of eigenvalue size)", y = "fraction of total variance explained") +
  ggtitle("Scree Plot")

## 5 Graph Critique in the Paper
### Log Transform of Histograms
The incident and reflected PAR histograms from Tolle et al. (figure 3a) have long tails and with large numbers of observations around 0 which make the charts hard to discern. We present this data after taking a log transform of the observations and present the results side-by-side with the initial chart versions (non-log scale). 
```{r, 5a-incident-charts}
# incident PAR charts

# need to account for the 0s...add small positive number

# Original Chart - No Log Transform
ggplot(all, aes(x = incident_par)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "blue4", color = "white", 
                 aes(y = (..count..)/sum(..count..)), binwidth = 250) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(), n.breaks = 10) +
  labs(title = 'Incident PAR - Original Scale') +
  xlab(expression('micromol/m'^2*'/s')) + 
  ylab("Percentage of Readings")

# Log Transform
ggplot(all, aes(x = log(incident_par + 0.001))) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = (..count..)/sum(..count..)), binwidth = .5) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +
  labs(title = 'Incident PAR - Log Scale') +
  xlab(expression('ln(micromol/m'^2*'/s)')) + 
  ylab("Percentage of Readings")

```
Both log charts visually convey the long tail better than the non-log counter-parts. In fact, the log scale displays a bimodal distributions that could be interpreted as light levels during the day and at night.

however, some readers might be mislead/confused by the log interpretation. At first glance, PAR measurements appear more concentrated around a smaller range and it's important readers understand the log function before reaching an incorrect conclusion derived from the plots. We've displayed both versions for clarity.

```{r, 5a-reflected-charts}
# reflected PAR
# Original Chart - No Log Transform
ggplot(all, aes(x = reflected_par)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "blue4", color = "white", 
                 aes(y = (..count..)/sum(..count..)), binwidth = 25) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(), n.breaks = 10) +
  labs(title = 'Reflected PAR - Original Scale') +
  xlab(expression('micromol/m'^2*'/s')) + 
  ylab("Percentage of Readings")

# Log Transform
ggplot(all, aes(x = log(reflected_par + 0.001))) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = (..count..)/sum(..count..)), binwidth = 0.8) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +
  labs(title = 'Reflected PAR - Log Scale') +
  xlab(expression('ln(micromol/m'^2*'/s)')) + 
  ylab("Percentage of Readings")

```

### Boxplot Analysis - Daytime Measurements Only

![Original Tolle Boxplots - 3c](./images/3c_plot_pic.JPG)

The boxplots from Figure 3[c] in the orginal paper are showing how the sensor measurements vary over the height of the tree. Tolle et al. are attempting to look for spatial gradients and trends by eliminating the temporal aspect of the data.

With regards to the PAR charts I don't believe these plots convey the right message. I think the author should have split up the temporal ranges included in this chart. For example, the PAR temporal range should only include daytime, when the sun is shining. Including the full temporal range adds a large number of data points with 0 light readings and effectively pulls the mass closer to zero for all readings and makes the gradient less pronounced.

We plotted the charts only considering daylight hours.

```{r, q5b-height-value-box-plots}
# try from 6:00 to 20:00
day_time = all %>%
  filter(time >= "06" & time <= "20")

# fix formatting for incident par boxplot and implement change for other dimensions (match paper)

# temperature

# humidity

# incident par
ggplot(day_time, aes(x=Height, y=incident_par, group = Height)) + 
    geom_boxplot() +
    coord_flip()

# reflected par

```


Some statement here about how the gradients over height become more clear when we strip out the night time measurements.

### Any suggestions for improving the first two plots in Figure 4? Can you distinguish all the colors in these two plots?

We think discretizing the time plot (maybe showing every hour) would make the content more digestible. Both charts are also lacking a legend and leave the onus on the reader to discern which heights correspond to which colors. To more clearly show height gradient we believe using a two-color continuum (shortest to tallest) would more clearly display the trend similar to what the author did in Figure 5.

### Comment on Figure 7. Is it possible to generate a better visualization to highlight the difference between network and log data?

The last chart displaying yield as a function of height and day is confusing and could have been left off. What do the lengths of the horizontal bars represent?

We also believe analyzing combined yield, in addition to individual data source yield, could have been beneficial to the reader. Presenting overlay charts across data sources might create better contrast between the two collection methods as it's difficult to make direct comparisons in the current format. The histograms we presented earlier, showing data source distinction by color, could have shown the importance of redundant data collection methods in a distributed sensor network and might have addressed some of the concerns in lessons learned about large gaps of missing data.
