# Red Wood Data Analysis

This project is contributed by 
1. Andrew Amore (Duke University)
2. Dylan (Shi-Ting) Lu (Duke University)

The data was collected in Sonoma, California on a single Redwood tree over a period of days at consistent time intervals during
the late spring/early summer. The main goal is to replicate the finding of Tolle et al (2005),  verify the existence of dynamic spatio-temporal gradients surrounding the tree and prove that complex biological theories can be validated using this measurement framework. 

We perform
1. Data cleaning
1. Exploratory data analysis
3. K-mean clustering
4. Principal Component Analysis (PCA analysis)
5. Visualization
