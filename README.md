# STA521 Project 1 - Red Wood Data Analysis Report
## Andrew Amore & Dylan (Shi-Ting) Lu

#TODO::
- think we need to try and match the quartiles from the paper (get close to the values or have an explanation for why they don't match/aren't close)
- identify one reading from each source over each epoch. Composite key should only have one reading for every entry in our analysis set.
