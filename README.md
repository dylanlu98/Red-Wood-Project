# Red Wood Data Analysis

This is a project attributed to

The data was collected in Sonoma, California on a single Redwood tree over a period of days at consistent time intervals during
the late spring/early summer. The main goal is to replicate the finding of Tolle et al (2005),  verify the existence of dynamic spatio-temporal gradients surrounding the tree and prove that complex biological theories can be validated using this measurement framework.We performed a exploratory data analysis and visualized results.
